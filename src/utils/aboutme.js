I began studying Architectural Technology at [Edinburgh College](http://www.edinburghcollege.ac.uk/) from 2014-2016, 
achieving my HND with a B. In college I had the chance to begin working on Revit, 
and studied topics such as fire safety and building construction. During my time at college I also
carried out work experience at [Cooper Cromer](https://www.coopercromar.com/) in Glasgow where I had the chance
to visit site and work closely with architects within the practice.

From 2016-2017 I worked as a Project Assistant at [HTA Design LLP](https://www.hta.co.uk/) through EDT â€“ the Year In Industry 
scheme, gaining experience where I was able to develop my office and administration skills 
as well as my hands-on architecture work. During my time at HTA I continued to develop my 
Revit and AutoCAD skills in a professional working environment, working closely with Architects 
and BIM Coordinators.

After I completed the year in industry I continued my studies at [Edinburgh Napier University](https://www.napier.ac.uk/),
starting as a direct entrant to second year. During my time at university I have been involved as a student assistant, teaching assistant,
a student mentor (as part of the universities "Widening Participation Team") and in my final year I became
the Events Lead for the newly founded Architectural Technology Society.

I have a keen interest in accuracy to Detail, Retrofit, U-Value and Energy calculations
and Regulations.

**On 9th July 2020 I was officially awarded a BSc HONS degree in Architectural Technology with Honours of the First Class.**
