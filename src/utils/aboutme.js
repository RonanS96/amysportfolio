I began studying Architectural Technology at [Edinburgh College](http://www.edinburghcollege.ac.uk/) from 2014-2016, 
achieving my HND with a B. In college I had the chance to begin working on Revit, 
and studied topics such as fire safety and building construction. During my time at college I also
carried out work experience at [Cooper Cromer](https://www.coopercromar.com/) in Glasgow where I had the chance
to visit site and work closely with architects within the practice.

From 2016-2017 I worked as a Project Assistant at [HTA Design LLP](https://www.hta.co.uk/) through EDT â€“ the Year In Industry 
scheme, gaining experience where I was able to develop my office and administration skills 
as well as my hands-on architecture work. During my time at HTA I continued to develop my 
Revit and AutoCAD skills in a professional working environment, working closely with Architects 
and BIM Coordinators.

Since I completed the year in industry, I have continued my studies at [Edinburgh Napier University](https://www.napier.ac.uk/).
Currently in my fourth year, I am working hard on a variety of projects and I am signed up to the
Widening Participation Associate Programme where I am working as a mentor for current college 
students looking ahead to university.

Alongside mentoring I am also a research fellow, which involves working closely with a research team in Edinburgh Napier University, investigating 
new insulations and retrofit of pre 1919 buildings in and around Scotlands central belt, and collecting and analysing data from pre and post insulating 
of these buildings.

I am projected to graduate in 2020 with my BSc (HONS).
